    <description><![CDATA[In this lesson we’re going to learn how what Variables are, why it’s good to use them and how to actually create them. We will then assign various values to variables to and use them solely, and in parameters.
We will also have a look at foreach loop so that we can e.g. ping multiple computers using single variable with multiple objects in it.
Exercises   Use Get-Command to find all commands that allow you to manage variables.]]></description>

There’s no need for telnet, ssh or psexec as PowerShell has its own protocol that’s built in right into Windows. We will look at how to create interactive sessions and send commands to multiple servers at once.
Exercises Notes Enable-Psremoting Enter-PSSesion ps-svr1 Hostname Get-Service GIP # I can even run commands that are not available on my source machine Get-ADDomainController Get-ADUser Exit or Exit-PSSession # Caution about double hoping Invoke-Command Invoke-Command -computerName ps-svr1 -command { get-service} # Invoke command executes commands on the remote comptuers and brings back the results # Can you tell a difference?]]></description>
