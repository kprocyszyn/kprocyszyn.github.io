# No pain, no gain.

How many times petty things have ruined your day? Or people? Or, even, yourself? Just admit it.

We can take a lot. Our minds are like massive hard drives which store data in a form of memories, feelings and thoughts.

Did you know that a human is able to erase certain bad memories or push them right back, deep in our subconscious? For example, women are going though unbelievable pain while giving a birth. Pain which lasts for hours, days or even weeks&#8230; If the process of erasing unpleasant experiences wouldn&#8217;t have happened, we would have had less babies right now&#8230;

Maybe something less extreme? The tooth pain for example. I think everyone at least once had it in their life. Would you be able to recall that pain? Because I&#8217;m not able to recall it at all. Or maybe I don&#8217;t want to? I remember the need for plenty of drugs to relief the pain. I can even remember my facial expression on my face which demonstrated a great pain and suffering. But the pain itself &#8211; not at all.

So what about the mental pain?

Not today. The mental pain can cause a serious damage to psychics or be even fatal if lasts too long. I had been trying to write down more about the mental pain, but I&#8217;m feeling like I&#8217;m not ready for it.

One day, I hope.
