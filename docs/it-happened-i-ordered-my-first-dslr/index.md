# It happened – I ordered my first DSLR.

When I look backwards, I have always been fascinated by a photography for quite a long time. But it really hit me about 4 years ago, when I bought some Panasonic camera with 16x zoom. It was only at that particular time that I thought zoom was the most important feature of a camera. Well, I can now say that it is cool to have zoom, but without vibration reduction you cannot do much on long focal length.

Anyway, time passed and I was taking some photographs, when I was showed by my old mate what was a macro photography. The view of detailed items really impressed me. But hey, it was all about taking pictures whenever I could, without focusing on advanced options.

After that, I bought my first high-end mobile phone. I was surprised (apart from specs of course) by its camera. Soon I realised that I really did not need the compact camera anymore, so I gave it to my brother. And stayed for good with mobile camera for the next 2 years.

During holiday time, my family came over and guess what &#8211; my brother brought the Panasonic camera with him &#8211; and obviously we were taking photos. After a day out, we sat in the front of my full HD TV and played some photos. That was it. I realised that camera from mobile phone actually isn&#8217;t that great.

I could clearly see a quality difference between dedicated camera device and mobile phone camera. As photos from my mobile phone were noisy, photos from my brother&#8217;s camera were sharp. But something was wrong! My mobile phone was a few times more expensive than this compact camera! Well, life was brutal this time.

I started to look for another camera. I learned that there are Compact, Bridge, System (or mirror-less) and DSLR cameras. As I wanted good quality of photos, with interchangeable lenses but not big and heavy camera itself, my choice went onto mirror-less camera. To be more specific &#8211; I chose Nikon 1 j1 with standard 10-30 mm lens. And it happened over a year ago.

Like before with previous camera, I was stunned by the quality of pictures. And the speed of taking pictures &#8211; this camera was able to take 60 pictures per minute! Anyway, another good piece of hardware made my days for a long time.

However, I found a few websites and blogs which were about photo business and/or hobby. I could see incredible pictures they had been taking. Well, I thought why shouldn’t I try? I armed myself in some online tutorials, YouTube videos and some settings. I did not know what Shutter speed was. Aperture was a mystery word to me. I knew that the higher ISO, the brighter picture, but I did not know high ISO causes noise to the pictures.

My proper manual photography education started off with 2 books: &#8220;Mastering Digital Photography&#8221; by Jason Youn and &#8220;The Digital Photography Book: Part 1&#8221; by Scott Kelby. The former book gave me all the theory I needed, the latter how to put theory into practise. In the meantime, I understood the reason to use tri-pod and why soft-light (or even golden hour) is what photographer is looking for.

As a result, my photo skills rapidly shot up and improved. I took thousands of photos and was never 100% satisfied. There was always something I could have corrected or improved.

About a month ago, I asked my good friend Robert to lend me his DSLR. He has Nikon d80 with 18-135mm lens. The quality of photos (bear in mind this DSLR was 5 years older than my Nikon 1 j1) was stunning. As I was practising my Nikon 1 for over a year, I could take a better quality pictures straight away with Nikon d80, and all the functions were under my fingers. With Nikon 1, when I wanted to change mode from automatic focus to manual, I had to go to special menu, change function, come back to taking photos mode, click ok, adjust focus setting, confirm, and take a picture. I know I missed many great possibilities of taking good photos. With DSLR the manual focus is a matter of switching mode on lens, adjust the ring and take a pic. It takes 2 second in comparison to 20.

I took me literally very short period of time to realise that what I need is DSLR, and my choice was Nikon d7100 with 18-140mm lens. I ordered it yesterday online, can&#8217;t wait to take it outside with me.

It was a long, all round journey to find my perfect DSLR. I wonder what it will bring me.
