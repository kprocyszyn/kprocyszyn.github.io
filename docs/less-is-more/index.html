<p>Having a choice is a great thing – I can pick stuff which really suits myself. In case I need, say, a teal corner 4 seater bed sofa, it’s just a matter of time and money I am prepared to spend, until I get one.</p>
<p>But what happens when I don’t have too many options? When there are 2 things which really suit me, but say, I’ve got space just for 1 sofa?</p>
<p>I can tell what’s going to happen – I will spend ridiculous amount of time comparing, looking for details I like more, reading and watching an awful lot of reviews. I am terrible at making that kind of decisions, so before I commit, I need to make sure it’s the right one.</p>
<p>I believe that you, similarly to me, make decisions on daily basis. The only 1st World Problem is like where should I get my lunch today, and we know very well, that this is sometimes a real mission.  I really don’t want to mention here much more serious decisions.</p>
<p>So it’s 1 pm, that amazing moment when I can start my journey to a sunny to the shops opposite. While most of them have similar assortment, there is always that long awaited question – ‘What are you having, today?’</p>
<p>Who knows, how could I know?</p>
<p>Actually, at which point do you make decision that you prefer a baguette with tuna chunks, mayo, and sweetcorn from one shop than another? Ok, once tried all possible shops around you can prefer which actually taste better, but before that? All baguettes are “freshly prepared today”, similar sizes and cost – so where is that decision made?</p>
<p>Well, it all apparently varies. Sometimes I could recall that brand name, sometimes logo appears to more than another, or maybe it is that cashier smiling nicely to you whenever you pass the shop?</p>
<p>So I’ve made a decision some time ago, to keep my lunch pretty simple. Monday: Panini, Tuesday: tuna, Wednesday: meatballs, Thursday: ordinary sandwich from a local grocery shop, Friday: it’s Friday, I don’t care.</p>
<p>Less is simple, less is better, less gives me more time. Did you notice that Steve Jobs or nowadays Mark Zuckerberg always wore the same cloths? Because it was simple, they didn’t need to waste time to decide “What am I wearing today?” Again, less is more.</p>
<p>Another great example of less is more is photography – every good shot has a certain message to a viewer. If it is a portrait, then you can see a sharp face on the first plan, and blurred background. That’s it, that’s all about a good portrait. There are obviously other tricks like focusing the view on the eyes, cutting slightly on the top of the hair or so called rule of the thirds – but that’s additions which enhance the portrait.</p>
<p>Eyes, face, action, emotions and expression – that’s the parts of the good portrait. And if you’ve got any other distraction like jewellery, objects or people on the background – then you are ruining your photo.</p>
<p>Once again, less distractions is more for the overall photo.</p>
<p>And there are hundreds of other examples like that – less in your CV, will allow the employer to focus on the most important parts of the CV. Doing only 1 task at the time rather than multitasking 10 at once will ensure that you will do the task better and faster, without the headache.</p>
<p>Less is more, it’s always better to focus on quality. Apart from health, friends, and money – probably it’s better to have more than less of these.</p>
