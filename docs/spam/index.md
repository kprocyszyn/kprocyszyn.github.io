# Spam

Spam. Spam everywhere. There isn&#8217;t a day without it. Without bombarding us with plenty of information. Way too much of information.

While the original &#8211; email spam &#8211; is well handled by email providers, the other sources are not.

On social media &#8211; there is plenty of shared stuff which someone (I hope so!) thought was worth of sharing. News is all over the place &#8211; starting from daily free newspapers, through radio and TV and ending up on the Internet. But the problem with the news is simple &#8211; there is plenty of repetition. And it is down to us &#8211; receivers &#8211; to pick best sources which fit us best.

It&#8217;s really easy to take in too much of information. While we as smart and modern human beings like to always be on top of everything &#8211; it&#8217;s really important not to put ourselves into information overload. Our brains are only able to handle a certain amount of information. It hadn&#8217;t been a big deal for centuries, until the spread of a massive media back in 20th century.

It&#8217;s pretty easy to select the right information: put on quality rather than quantity. There is no point in reading the same news 5 times a day. But it is smart to use two completely opposite sources, &#8217;cause ya know &#8211; the truth lies between the lines.
