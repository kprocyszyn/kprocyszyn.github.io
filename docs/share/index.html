There was no Internet, there was no one really to ask for advice or share the knowledge with me.

<p>I had to figure this out, and it took me ridiculous amount of time to achieve such a basic task like reinstalling an operating system. It would have been much easier to find that knowledge somewhere, wouldn’t be?</p>
<p>After years, the Internet got popular and I’ve met more people. The knowledge has been waiting to be discovered and absorbed. And so I did. I have been deriving knowledge for years from different sources. But wasn’t really keen to share what was mine.</p>
<p>Until this year. Something’s changed in my mind. Maybe because I am surrounded with open-minded people who actually share with the world they knowledge and experience. Certainly, I’ve been impressed by them.</p>
<p>How I came to this conclusion? Just this week, I’ve helped a group of people with tasks which for me are obvious, but not for them. I spent some time on preparing the guidelines, the files and even an instructional video on the task, and boom – their job became a way easier.</p>
<p>Sharing is rewarding. Just give it a try, you won’t regret it.</p>
