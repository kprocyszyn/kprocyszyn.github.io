# Do something different

Sometimes I am so deep in my thoughts that I have no notion of what time of the day is. I know I should be doing something, anything but wasting my time&#8230; Life is too short to waste time but all the possibilities somehow don’t even cross my mind.

Do you get the same feeling where you can literally stare at the wall opposite while the time stands still? It’s a horrible feeling. It can last forever. Lethargic state of mind.

This is the time when I need to talk to myself – what the hell are you doing?! Move, walk, DO something! Anything!

I remember one day when I was sitting in my room and didn&#8217;t have a clue what to do. And there it was, there was my father’s guitar. I asked him whether I could use it, he obviously said I should go for it. And so I did.

At that very moment, I just wanted to do something different. I never played before, but that wasn’t a problem, I was just practising. That moment turned into a quite few good years of daily playing, having meeting other people who have been playing instruments and singing. Just because I tried something different.

There have been singing in choir, psychology and knowing about peoples’ characters, computer graphics which gave me the foundation of photo processing a few years ago, photography and writing&#8230;And I take that this is the reason how you come across his site.

There were plenty of others hobbies which I don’t recall at the moment – because they probably didn&#8217;t&#8217; last long&#8230;

At the very last paragraph I’ve left my life time hobby – the game changer of my life – computers and technology. Who could tell, that bringing Commodore Amiga and later on PC would completely consume me, that much that actually I wanted to be a computer geek. Who could tell that it would have shaped my career to be a sysadmin? No one could. But it happened, and that’s one of the things which makes me happy.

Therefore, if you have nothing better to do, go and do something different.
