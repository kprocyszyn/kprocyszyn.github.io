In this lesson we will be preparing our workstation for writing PowerShell scripts. We will start by enabling RSAT and then install Visual Studio Code which is a recommended and free PowerShell code editor. 

We will then have a look at the basic function of VS Code and create a simple &#8220;Hello World&#8221; script.

## Exercises

If you haven&#8217;t followed along, you definitely would like to install VS Code and create a *.ps1 file. Then create a script that will display your name.

## Notes

```powershell
#Print out text
"Hello World!"
"Hi"
"My name is"
"Kamil Procyszyn"
#Run AD command
Get-ADDomain
```
