When we buy a new phone, manufacturers advertise it always as a super fast with superb colours and a long lasting battery.

Usually it&#8217;s true, which we can confirm just after the unboxing ritual when we hold our brand new device in the hands.

It&#8217;s shiny, without scratches, with a specific smell, plus it&#8217;s really fast and battery lasts very long.

Until&#8230; we actually start using the phone, by this I mean installing the whole lot of our favourite apps.  Some of them are just sitting there, not being used.

By the way, the apps are comparable to instant messenger. What&#8217;s a point of using the best, fastest and most secured instant messenger when actually there is nobody to chat with. Same with mobile apps, if there are no mobile apps, it&#8217;s highly likely that we won&#8217;t use that mobile phone.

As an example, let&#8217;s just look at  once great and almighty BlackBerry as well as Windows Phone &#8211; they actually don&#8217;t have the same amount of decent applications as Android or iOS, and due to that reason, they are not that popular these days.

My question here is &#8211; what is a difference between a brand new phone, and say, one month old one? The latter one will be definitively slower, and the battery will get be getting flat quicker.

The core of the problem here is that the mobile phone&#8217;s operating systems run all the apps in the background. No matter what you do (OK, unless you try to get so called root rights, but let&#8217;s ignore it for the moment, as firstly it&#8217;s unofficial, secondly it&#8217;s likely to void your warranty. And it might brick your device) as long as the app installed, it runs in the background.

Another problem here is, we can&#8217;t help that. The app runs in the background. That obviously impacts the performance as well as battery. Have you ever found your phone hot, but it was unused for a longer period of time? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about.

Recently, I have <a href="https://kamilpro.com/overloaded/" target="_blank">removed the Facebook&#8217;s app from my phone</a> (the reason wasn&#8217;t the performance, though) and noticed that phone has been working much faster, and has much more juice thought out the day.

That lead me to an idea&#8230;

If there is such a difference between the default system and the one we actually use, why we as customers, cannot have some kind of comparison before buying the phone?

There could be a few users profiles: a business, teenager, and a photographer. Each profile would have a set of predefined apps running on it, and we as the customers would be able to see what is the actual phone&#8217;s performance and how long it would last on battery.

I, as a practical guy, I&#8217;m rather after the real results than theoretical ones.
