but I&#8217;m certain that 28 will be even better!

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Yes, yesterday was my birthday.  Another great year has passed but this time with a wonderful woman next to my side.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s unbelievable how many good things have happened in the last 365 days. I could now start telling you and show off&#8230; but not on this occasion, this is a celebration time!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  On the days like these, I think about changing my settings to neutral, stop rushing and just sit calmly and wait for what comes next&#8230;anything&#8230;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  No. That&#8217;s not going to happen.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  One of the things I&#8217;ve learnt in life is to keep pushing and keep trying. Results not always come quickly, it usually takes time, effort and patience to develop something marvelous. I know, we live in insta-world and want to have everything now, ideally nicely packed delivered straight to our doorstep.

  In my view, you don&#8217;t get older, untill you&#8217;d like to learn and try new things. And so I do.
