I&#8217;m going to share with you super simple tip how to get things done. All you need is music (must), headphones (ideally) and&#8230;

<h1 aria-level="1">
  One song
</h1>

This is that simple, one song which will play constantly on repeat. The key is, you must like the song, and (at least in my case) it must be quite repetitive in itself, with a similar bit. And should be vibrant, to keep you going.

You can consider it as the background music often found in movies – it&#8217;s there, you can hear it, you know that it&#8217;s there, but it&#8217;s only in the background not distracting your attention from the action.

We&#8217;re going to apply the same pattern here – your work/task is going to be a movie, why looped music works as the background. So&#8230; action!

  I find it especially useful when:

  Knowing very well how to do something

There are &#8220;muscle memorised&#8221; tasks, which you learnt by heart, something you can flip the switch and start doing. It&#8217;s cool until that task must be repeated tens or hundreds of times, and somehow cannot be automated.

Having constant same rhythm helps to keep the right pace, while the music itself doesn&#8217;t distract as it&#8217;s on repeat.

<h2 aria-level="2">
  It is loud
</h2>

I&#8217;m single-threaded when we talk about multitasking – or in other words, can focus on 1 thing at the time. That means any sounds distract me.

Yawing. Headache. Boredom. Even anger. That&#8217;s what happens when I need to focus and can&#8217;t due to distractions around me. Especially in the office or any other loud environment, my mind can&#8217;t hang just on the task, cause there are some many distractions. And you can&#8217;t tell these distractions to shut up.

Simplest remedy – put the headphones on. A simple announcement that &#8220;guys, I need to focus and will put my headphones on, I won&#8217;t hear you&#8221; is enough to make everyone happy.

Then choose a song, put it on repeat, make it loud and crack on. You&#8217;ve got 100% control over your focus, mind and work.

<h2 aria-level="1">
  Work in bursts
</h2>

It&#8217;s a good practice to <a href="https://kamilpro.com/start-batching-your-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">batch the work</a> whenever possible. So once you&#8217;ve accumulated enough repetitive tasks, go and apply the productive loop on them. You&#8217;ll notice that your tasks will be done way faster and with a greater pleasure than before.  Who doesn&#8217;t like to listen to favourite songs and getting stuff done at the same time?

I tend to work on firewalls, shell or spreadsheets that way.

  I hope it will help you to be more productive

Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. I think we can easily assign this method to a straight forward way of improving your workflow!
